The single page application updates the added note dynamically instead of requiring a redirect. However, it does not update notes added by others without refreshing the page, which is kind of bad.

    participant browser
    participant server
    
    browser->>server: POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
    activate server
    Note right of browser: XHttp is used to post the new note. Then javascript code adds it to the list locally.
    server-->>browser: HTTP 201 Created
    deactivate server
    
    Note right of browser: No page refreshing is done here.
